## This file is NOT PART OF OUR PROJECT. This is a global file in a central location. For Mac/Linux users it goes in your home directory ~/.npmrc.

## For Windows users it goes in your home directory as well, though the syntax will be different. Something along the lines of C:\Users\{YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME}
